Modern Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) were first implemented as analogues to terrestrial parks, often located on clear bio-geographic features such as coral reefs that are relatively fixed in space and time. These central features served as natural aggregation points for a large number of species, many of which make particular reefs  their home for much of their adult life. As a result, protection of key habitat features in MPAs likely meant effective protection for many different kinds of species. 

MPAs are set to expand in scale dramatically over the coming years though. As we seek to protect larger and larger areas within MPAs, many of these large protected areas will begin to encompass not only nearshore habitats such as reefs and estuaries, but also open-ocean ecosystems with starkly different dynamics. These open-ocean areas are likely to be primarily populated by highly mobile species such as sharks, tunas, and sea turtles that cover vast distances throughout their lifetimes and within years, following a shifting spatial pattern of currents, upwellings, and eddies. These ecosystems post a new set of challenges for MPA design. 

One challenge in particular relates to the displacement of fishing effort. When an MPA is enacted, fishing vessels that used to operate in the now protected area are faced with a choice to either exit the fishery or relocate to a new fishing ground outside the MPA. In the absernce of other managemnt measures, this redistribution of fishing effort can result in increased fishing pressure on populations outside of MPA borders. As such, the net conservation benefit to the population of a species partially covered by an MPA is a balance between the conservation gains inside the MPA and the potential conservation losses outside. 

This dynamic is well known, but many of the MPA design tools are not well equipped to deal with the complexities of open-ocean species. To address this problem, we have developed a new spatially explicit bio-economic model called `marlin` (not an acronym, but a reference to both the sea, as in spanish *mar*, and the speedy marlins that inhabitant the open oceans). `marlin` allows users to simulate the effect of MPAs on multiple species with both nearshore and open-ocean life history strategies, mediated through the actions of multiple fishing fleets each with their own fishing styles and species preferences. Importantly, `marlin` does this very efficiently, simulating hundreds of years of multiple species of age-structured populations targeted by multiple fishing fleets across hundreds of spatial cells in seconds or less. 

To demonstrate both the need and ability of the `marlin` package, we constructed a case study based around a yellowfin tuna population actively targeted by a fishing fleet, and a shortfin mako population that is caught as bycatch in the tuna fishery. 

For our first simulation, we will use `marlin` to construct a scenario where both the sharks and the tunas prefer to live along the coastline. While the fishing fleet much prefers to catch yellowfin tuna, they do make some money off of any sharks they catch. The fishing fleet is defined by a fixed amount of fishing effort, and the fleet decides where in spaces to go fish based on the past profitability of different fishing areas. Due to this pressure, The tuna population has been moderately exploited, and the mako population overfished.

```

We can then simulation a scenario in which a large MPA is placed along the coastline


```{r}


set.seed(42)
#specify some MPA locations
mpa_locations <- expand_grid(x = 1:resolution, y = 1:resolution) %>%
mutate(mpa = x > 15 & y < 15)

mpa_locations %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x,y, fill = mpa)) + 
  geom_tile() + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Accent", direction  = -1, name = "MPA") + 
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Lat") + 
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Lon")
```

`marlin` then lets us simulate the effect of that MPA on both the yellowfin and mako populations. 

```{r}

a <- Sys.time()

nearshore_mpa <- simmar(
  fauna = fauna,
  fleets = fleets,
  years = years,
  mpas = list(locations = mpa_locations,
              mpa_year = floor(years * .5))
)

Sys.time() - a

proc_nearshore_mpa <- process_marlin(nearshore_mpa, time_step =  fauna[[1]]$time_step)

```

```{r}

proc_nearshore_mpa %>%
  filter(step == max(step)) %>%
  group_by(x, y, critter) %>%
  summarise(ssb = sum(ssb)) %>%
  group_by(critter) %>% 
  mutate(ssb = ssb / max(ssb)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x, y, fill = ssb)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(
    name = "Density",
    guide = guide_colorbar(
      frame.colour = "black",
      tick.colour = "black",
      nbin = 1000,
      barwidth = unit(15, "lines")
    )
  ) +
  facet_wrap( ~ critter) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

In this scenario the nearshore MPA provides conservation benefits to both the mako and tuna populations

```{r}

nearshore_mpa_ssb <- proc_nearshore_mpa %>% 
  group_by(step,x,y, critter) %>% 
  summarise(ssb = sum(ssb)) %>% 
  left_join(mpa_locations, by = c("x","y")) %>% 
  group_by(step, critter, mpa) %>% 
  summarise(ssb = sum(ssb))
  

# nearshore_mpa_ssb %>% 
#   ggplot(aes(step,ssb, color = mpa)) + 
#   geom_line() + 
#   facet_wrap(~critter, scales = "free_y")

nearshore_mpa_ssb %>% 
  group_by(step, critter) %>% 
  summarise(ssb = sum(ssb)) %>% 
  group_by(critter) %>% 
  mutate(ssb = ssb / max(ssb)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(step,ssb)) + 
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0)) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = floor(years * .5), color = "MPA Created"), linetype = 2) +
  geom_line(size = 3, color = "steelblue") + 
  facet_wrap(~critter, scales = "free_y") + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, NA), labels = scales::percent, name = "% of Unfished Biomass") + 
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Year")


```

Now though, consider a different scenario. Here the tunas still slightly prefer their same nearshore habitat, but now the shortfin mako population primarily lives farther offshore. We will first simulate that population without the MPA, and then assess the effects of the exact same MPA on this new scenario. 


```{r}

yft_habitat <- expand_grid(x = 1:resolution, y = 1:resolution) %>%
  mutate(habitat =  .2 * x) %>%

  select(-x) %>% 
  as.matrix()
 

mako_habitat <- expand_grid(x = 1:resolution, y = 1:resolution) %>%
  mutate(habitat =  dnorm(x, 9,5)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = y, values_from = habitat) %>% 
  select(-x) %>% 
  as.matrix()

  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, NA))

```

What happens to the total populations of both shortfin mako and yellowfin tuna now? The tuna population shows the same trajectory, since the fishing fleet is more or less disinterested in the mako population. The MPA has a starkly different impact on the mako population though. The concentration of the fishing fleets in the waters outside the MPA that hold the highest concentrations of yellowfin tuna result in the mako shark population actually 15% below the population levels that would have existed without the MPA.

Another scenario includes being able to appropriately account for the costs (fines) associated with catching vulnerable species. We will begin by resetting the habitat preferences and species information to those used in the first example.

      barwidth = unit(15, "lines")
    )
  ) +
  facet_wrap( ~ critter) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

```{r}

negative_prices_ssb <- proc_negative_prices %>%

  scale_x_continuous(name = "Year")
```

In this scenario, we see that if the costs associated with catching a Shortfin Mako are equal to or exceed the profits associated with Yellowfin Tuna, both populations will show a constant and high percentage of unfished biomass; it's simply not worth it because of the high degree of habitat overlap. 

Let's try another example, this time where the two habitat preferences do not overlap. 

```{r}
# define some parameters

years <- 100

tune_type <- "explt"

# make up some habitat

In this scenario, we see a similar result in which fishers avoid areas with Shortfin Mako, keeping the population at a high % of unfished biomass, but targeting Yellowfin Tuna. Eventually, the % of unfished biomass for Yellowfin Tuna also increases, likely due to the dispersion of individuals into areas that are also occupied by Shortfin Mako. 

This short exercise both demonstrates the capabilities of `marlin`, and the critical need for this sort of modeling. As we begin to design MPAs tasked with protecting not only coastal ecosystems but also open-ocean areas and pelagic species, it is critical that we directly address the challenges posed by the different life histories and fleet dynamics of these offshore systems. This example only contains two species and one fleet; one can imagine that in the absence of a clear organizing feature like a reef, and given the complex movement dynamics of pelagic species and fishing fleets, designing an effective blue-water MPA may be quite challenging without a strong modeling framework capable of exploring the takeoffs inherent in designing spatial protection. 

At the moment `marlin` is focused on simulating finfish species. However, in the coming weeks we intend to add support for a variety of other types of animals, including marine mammals and sea turtles.
